title: Bad Design: The Williams Course Catalog

---

The Williams CS department webpage is an example of good design because it is simple and demonstrates exactly where one should go for anything one could be looking for. One good aspect is the locaiton of the news section. This section, which chages as times goes on, is located at the bottom of the page. This ensure that the initial screen that users see is reasonable static and does not change. This allows for easier navigation because the user knows what to expect.
