title: Bad Design: The Williams Course Catalog
subtitle: DSF
---

The course catalog is bad design because it sacrifices utility in order to make a "pretty" interface. Each of the department pages are hidden behind its divison banner. The issue with this is that if you were browsing classes in departments that reside in different divisions, you have to close the division banner and open the new one before finding the next department, and then the class that you were looking at. This process is slow on slower computers and adds frustating time to the transitions while browsing through classes. The worst part of it all is that the earlier design as very functional. It had plain text links and a very simply website design. It may not have been visually stunning, but it was fast to load and intuitive to use.
