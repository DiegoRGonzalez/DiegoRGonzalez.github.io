Problem:
---
When visiting a new place, it is often difficult to plan out your day such that you are able to visit as many interesting locations as possible. This is due to the fact that you are new to this place and do not know which places are worth visiting. If a list of places are in fact given, choosing the most efficient path between them can be difficult as well.

Analysis:
---
People have attempted to solve this problem in the past. With lists on sites such as TripAdvisor.com and Fodors.com, travelers can see which locations that are popular with other tourists and descriptions of those places. They can then judge for themselves whether that location is worth visiting. The trouble with this is that there is a definite bias towards what can be considered as “Tourist” locations. On top of that, new locations will not be featured on such lists since these lists are often static, they do not update themselves. Another issue is that these websites simply give a list of places to go, leaving the task of deciding in what order to visit these locations up to the traveler themselves.

Proposal:
---
I propose a phone application that assists in planning a walking tour of an unfamiliar place. Using information scraped from wikipedia and google maps, this app would suggest locations that are both interesting and nearby. Once at a location, the user is given facts about the location. Users then will select the next location, so on and so forth, learning about place that they are visiting in the process. If the user would like a restaurant or a public restroom, the application can suggest those locations as well.

The inspiration for this application came from the brainstorming activity that we did in class on 02/08/2018
