Problem:
---
When visiting a new city, it is often difficult to plan out your day such that you are able to visit as many interesting locations as possible. This is due to the fact that you are new to this place and do not know which places are worth visiting. If a list of places are in fact given, choosing the most efficient path between them can be difficult as well.

Analysis:
---
When people are confronted with this issue, they go one of two routes. They either decide to plan nothing and decide where to go on the day of or they spend the night before researching and planning their day. Those who go the first route may see interesting locations simply by going towards what looks interesting on the street, but much time is lost wandering around and potentially interesting locations may be walked right past. Those who go with the second options consult lists on sites such as TripAdvisor.com and Fodors.com, where travelers can see which locations that are popular with other tourists and descriptions of those places. They can then judge for themselves whether that location is worth visiting. The trouble with this is that there is a definite bias towards what can be considered as “Tourist” locations. These locations are heavily visited, but may not be the only interesting locations in an area. On top of that, new locations will not be featured on such lists since these lists are often static, they do not update themselves. Another issue is that these websites simply give a list of places to go, leaving the task of deciding in what order to visit these locations up to the traveler themselves. Though a decent path through these locations may be created by the tourist, the tourist may then feel rushed when going through the city because they know they have five more locations to visit before the day is over.

Proposal:
---
I propose a phone application that strikes a middle ground between the two approaches listed in our analysis above and assists in planning a walking tour of an unfamiliar city. Using information scraped from wikipedia and google maps, this app would suggest locations that are both interesting and nearby. Once at a location, the user is given facts about the location. Users then will select the next location, so on and so forth, learning about place that they are visiting in the process. This will allow users to efficiently go from place to place and see as much of the city as possible, while going at their own pace. If the user would like a restaurant or a public restroom, the application can suggest those locations as well. At the end of the day, the user will then have a path that they took through the city. This information can be then used by the app to possibly suggest popular routes to future tourists.

The inspiration for this application came from the brainstorming activity that we did in class on 02/08/2018
